# SpaceRock

## A space game where you grab space rocks and grow your gravitational influence

### Required Modules:
pygame

### How to run:
1. Save files to local machiene 
2. Install pygame module
3. Run SpaceRockGame.py in terminal

### Gameplay Instructions:

Once the game is running you should see a window similar to the screenshot below. The green blob in the middle is your player and your goal is to gobble up as many space rocks as you can. All the objects (including you) move under the influence of gravity, so to start you may find yourself getting pulled about by massive objects nearby. Use the arrow keys to give yourself thrust and move about the map. The screen will follow you as you do, but if you go too far you'll be in intersteller space and you are on your own. Be sure the make use of the radar screen in the lower righthand corner to not get lost. 

One final note, as you thrust you are expelling matter into space and your total mass will reflect the mass ejected by your blob. If you accelerate too much you'll find yourself back at square one and have to hunt down more rocks to increase your mass again. Use your gravity to help you pull rocks toward yourself and see how massive you can get!
